# LC-filter
## Introduction
This project contains the MATLAB code of the paper "Line-Circle: A Geometric Filter for Single Camera Edge-Based Object Detection". To use the code, run `main_offline.m` from the MATLAB command line. This will run the filter with some example pictures. To use the real-time version of the filter, type `run main_rt.m`.

## Dependencies
To run the real-time version:

- MATLAB `mobiledev` package
- MATLAB `webcam` package
- Requires a web camera and an Android/iOS tablet. 

## Credits
This project depends on *fast9* edge detection algorithm, which is developed by **Edward Rosten**, **Reid Porter** and **Tom Drummond**.
