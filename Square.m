function [S, C, Cr] = Square(S, C, Cr, delta, Vv, Dv)

% Take a normal circle


% Find a furthest distance of circle at same velocity


% Does couple C(A) and C(B) found?


% Any normal/rebel circle found?


% Include any circle that matches same velocity and certain angle


% Create square and estimated with any matched S'(k-1)


% Does just unmatched circles left (no match of case A and B)?


% Match remaining circles as a squre


% return S
